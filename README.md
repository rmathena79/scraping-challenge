Data Analytics Boot Camp Module 11 Challenge

## Contents
- **part_1_mars_news_RPM.ipynb**: My solution to the Part 1 of the challenge
- **part_1_mars_news_starter.ipynb**: Starter notebook for Part 1 of the challenge
- **part_2_mars_weather_RPM.ipynb**: My solution to the Part 2 of the challenge
- **part_2_mars_weather_starter.ipynb**: Starter notebook for Part 2 of the challenge
- **mars_weather.csv**: The data produced by my Part 2 notebook

## Instructions
From an environment set up with standard modules for class, including the ability to use Splinter (not necessarily Selenium directly), just launch any notebook and run the cells.

## Notes
There is an error in the starter notebook provided. The final graph purports to show Martian temperatures, with terrestrial days along the X axis. But this graph assumes each row of data corresponds to sequential terrestrial days. In fact there are gaps.
